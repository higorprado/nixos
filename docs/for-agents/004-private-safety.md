# Private Safety

## Never read or track these files

- `private/users/*/*.nix`
- `private/users/*/*/*.nix`
- `private/hosts/*/*.nix`
- `private/hosts/*/*/*.nix`

These are gitignored and contain real usernames, SSH keys, and personal paths.

## Before committing: run the safety check

```bash
./scripts/check-repo-public-safety.sh
```

This script checks that no private data (real usernames, SSH keys,
email addresses, IP addresses outside approved ranges) appears in tracked files.

## The tracked-user pattern

In this personal repo, the tracked runtime uses the canonical `username` fact
for the shared tracked user.

Tracked runtime consumers should reference that fact directly:
```nix
let userName = config.username; in ...
```

Tracked runtime wiring should prefer `config.username` when a lower-level module
truly needs the tracked user.

## Hardcoded home paths

Default rule:

- do not introduce new hardcoded `"/home/username"` paths in tracked files
- use `config.home.homeDirectory` in HM modules where possible
- use `config.username` in NixOS modules when one tracked user is needed

Current state:

- there is no live tracked hardcoded home-path exception in module code
- historical docs/progress logs may still mention old concrete paths as part of
  recorded migration history

If a new tracked hardcoded home path is ever reintroduced, document the reason
explicitly here and make the public-safety allowlist change intentional.
