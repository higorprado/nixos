# Predator Impermanence Btrfs Plan

## Goal

Migrate `predator` to an impermanence-style layout using:
- `impermanence` for the centralized persistence inventory
- Btrfs for the persistent storage layout
- Btrfs root reset/rollback instead of `tmpfs /`

The target outcome is:
- host persistence policy declared in one predator-scoped place
- no feature knowing about `/persist`
- persistent state explicitly listed through `environment.persistence`
- root reset on boot while keeping `@nix`, `@log`, `/home`, and `/persist`

## Architectural Rules

These rules are mandatory for whoever executes this plan.

1. Persistence ownership is host-scoped, not feature-scoped.
   - `docker.nix` and `podman.nix` must stay generic.
   - no feature may hardcode `/persist`.

2. `den` still owns feature composition.
   - the `predator` host decides that persistence/impermanence applies.
   - the persistence module is attached from `predator`, not from generic features.

3. `impermanence` centralizes what persists.
   - features continue to define services and packages
   - the predator persistence module defines the persisted files/directories
   - keep the predator persistence module declarative and close to upstream `impermanence` usage
   - do not keep permanent bootstrap or migration hacks in activation scripts after the first rollout

4. `aurelius` is out of scope.
   - nothing in this plan should leak predator-only persistence assumptions into shared features

## Scope

In scope:
- add the `impermanence` flake input/module
- revert the host-specific persistence coupling currently placed in shared features
- add a predator-scoped persistence module
- add a diagnostic script to surface new root-state candidates that may need persistence later
- centralize the persistence inventory with `environment.persistence."/persist"`
- prepare and implement Btrfs root reset/rollback for `@root`
- validate normal boot/reboot with the new model

Out of scope:
- `tmpfs /`
- `aurelius`
- redesigning unrelated desktop stacks
- long-term coredump retention strategy
- converting rootful Podman into a required workflow if it is not used

## Current State

### Current mount/layout state

- `/` -> `@root`
- `/nix` -> `@nix`
- `/var/log` -> `@log`
- `/persist` -> `@persist`
- `/home` -> separate persistent Btrfs disk
- `/boot` -> vfat ESP
- `/swap/swapfile` -> persistent swapfile with resume configured

### Current measured root size

After cleanup:
- `/` total: about `155 MiB`
- `/tmp`: `0`
- `/var`: about `69 MiB`
- `/usr`: about `85 MiB`
- `/etc`: negligible

### Current problem to correct first

The repo currently contains an architectural mistake:
- [docker.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/system/docker.nix) sets `data-root = "/persist/var/lib/docker"`
- [podman.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/system/podman.nix) sets rootful storage under `/persist`

That is wrong because:
- `/persist` is a predator host concern
- those feature modules are shared
- if another host enables Docker/Podman, it inherits a predator-only layout

This must be fixed before the impermanence rollout continues.

## Persistence Diagnosis

### Already persisted outside the root lifecycle

These do not need to be re-solved by impermanence:
- `/nix`
- `/var/log`
- `/home`
- `/boot`
- `/swap/swapfile`

### Must persist for correctness

These should be declared centrally in the predator persistence module and backed by `/persist`:

- `/etc/machine-id`
  - stable machine identity
- `/etc/ssh`
  - host SSH keys
- `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`
  - Wi-Fi and saved network profiles
- `/var/lib/bluetooth`
  - pairing and trust state
- `/var/lib/tailscale`
  - node identity/state
- `/var/lib/docker`
  - `predator` uses Docker and its rootful state must survive reboot
- `/var/lib/systemd/random-seed`
  - preserve entropy seed across boots

### Password/login state

Do not persist `/etc/shadow` through `impermanence`.

Reason:
- the `impermanence` upstream does not document `/etc/shadow` as a supported persisted file
- the `predator` rollout already proved this breaks `update-users-groups.pl` during activation with:
  - `rename: Device or resource busy`

The supported design here is:
- keep `/etc/shadow` ephemeral
- provide the user password through standard NixOS user options
- for this repo, the private host override must use:
  - `users.users.higorprado.hashedPasswordFile = "/persist/secrets/higorprado-password-hash";`

This keeps the hash:
- outside the repo
- persistent across root resets
- compatible with normal NixOS user activation

### Persist only if the workflow exists

- `/var/lib/containers/storage`
  - only if rootful Podman use matters
  - rootless Podman already persists under `/home`
- `/var/lib/systemd/coredump`
  - only if persistent coredumps are desired
  - if kept, prefer `@log`, not `@persist`

### Explicitly ephemeral

These should stay ephemeral unless a concrete reason appears:
- `/tmp`
- most of `/var/cache`
- `/var/lib/AccountsService`
- `/var/lib/NetworkManager`
- `/var/lib/upower`
- `/var/lib/fwupd`
- `/var/lib/nixos`
- `/var/lib/dms-greeter`
- `/var/lib/regreet`

## Why `impermanence` Is The Right Tool Here

For this repo, the value of `impermanence` is not `tmpfs`. It is:
- one centralized persistence inventory
- explicit ownership of persisted state
- less chance of scattering persistence decisions through features

That makes it a better fit than continuing with per-feature `/persist` settings.

## Target Architecture

### Shared features

- `docker.nix` only enables/configures Docker generically
- `podman.nix` only enables/configures Podman generically
- neither feature may know about `/persist`

### Predator host

`predator` owns:
- importing `impermanence`
- importing the predator persistence module
- exposing or documenting the persistence-candidate diagnostic workflow
- importing the Btrfs root-reset wiring

Recommended placement:
- `hardware/predator/impermanence.nix`
- `hardware/predator/root-reset.nix`
- `scripts/report-persistence-candidates.sh`

### Central persistence declaration

The predator persistence module should contain a single central block:
- `environment.persistence."/persist"`

and list:
- `directories = [ ... ]`
- `files = [ ... ]`

This is the inventory of persistent state for the host.

### Root reset model

Use Btrfs root reset/rollback, not `tmpfs`.

The intended model is:
- keep a clean base root subvolume or snapshot, e.g. `@root-blank`
- on boot, recreate/reset `@root` from that clean state
- mount the usual persistent subvolumes back in:
  - `/nix`
  - `/var/log`
  - `/persist`
  - `/home`
  - `/boot`

### Why This Is Not The README Snippet Verbatim

The upstream `impermanence` README shows Btrfs root reset with:

- `boot.initrd.postResumeCommands = '' ... ''`

That exact form does not work on `predator`, because this host uses:

- `boot.initrd.systemd.enable = true`

On this host, NixOS rejects `boot.initrd.postResumeCommands` with a build-time
assertion and requires equivalent logic under:

- `boot.initrd.systemd.services`

That means the upstream Btrfs reset pattern must be adapted into an initrd
systemd unit here.

There is one more initrd-specific detail:

- the first systemd-unit implementation failed at boot with
  `mount: command not found`

The correct fix is not a permanent pile of absolute paths. The correct fix is to
use the stage-1 tool mechanism NixOS already provides:

- `boot.initrd.systemd.initrdBin = [ ... ]`

and keep the service script itself using normal command names.

## Risks To Handle Explicitly

### Risk 1: Boot failure if `/persist` is missing

Already seen in practice:
- `persist.mount` failed
- `local-fs.target` failed
- emergency mode

Mitigation:
- never activate persistence wiring unless `@persist` exists live
- manual Btrfs mount verification remains mandatory before first activation

### Risk 2: Missing persistence inventory

This is the main impermanence risk.

Mitigation:
- start with a conservative first inventory
- prefer persisting one extra path over forgetting a critical path
- verify real services after each activation and reboot

### Risk 3: Hibernation/resume

`predator` has:
- `/swap/swapfile`
- `boot.resumeDevice`
- `resume_offset`

Changing root-reset behavior is not the same as changing swap, but hibernation must still be revalidated after the root-reset phase.

Mitigation:
- normal boot/reboot first
- hibernate/resume later as a dedicated compatibility slice

## Rollout Strategy

Do not jump directly to root reset.

Use this order:
1. fix the architectural mistake in shared features
2. add `impermanence` and the central persistence inventory
3. add the persistence-candidate diagnostic script
4. verify the persistence inventory with no root reset yet
5. add Btrfs root-reset wiring
6. test reboot
7. test hibernate/resume later

## First-Migration Rule

`impermanence` does not migrate existing root state for you.

For the first time a new path is added to `environment.persistence`, the correct workflow is:

1. pre-seed the target under `/persist` manually
2. for file-backed persisted paths, remove the live root copy before activation if needed
3. activate the config
4. reboot to confirm the persisted mount now owns that path

This migration procedure is operational, not architectural:
- it should be documented
- it may use one-shot/manual commands
- it should not remain as a permanent activation hack in the live module

## Phases

### Phase 0: Baseline and safety

Goal:
- ensure the currently working state is committed and recoverable

Validation:
- `./scripts/check-repo-public-safety.sh`
- `./scripts/run-validation-gates.sh structure`
- `nix build --no-link path:$PWD#nixosConfigurations.predator.config.system.build.toplevel`

Status:
- already satisfied before this plan update

### Phase 1: Remove host persistence policy from shared features

Targets:
- [docker.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/system/docker.nix)
- [podman.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/system/podman.nix)

Changes:
- remove `/persist`-specific storage paths from shared features
- restore generic Docker/Podman behavior in those feature modules

Validation:
- `./scripts/run-validation-gates.sh structure`
- `nix build --no-link path:$PWD#nixosConfigurations.predator.config.system.build.toplevel`
- `nix build --no-link path:$PWD#nixosConfigurations.aurelius.config.system.build.toplevel`
- `nix store diff-closures` against previous predator system

Expected diff:
- only removal of the misplaced host-specific storage paths from shared features

Commit target:
- `refactor: remove predator persistence policy from shared container features`

### Phase 2: Add `impermanence` and a predator-scoped persistence module

Targets:
- `flake.nix`
- `flake.lock`
- [predator.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/hosts/predator.nix)
- [impermanence.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/hardware/predator/impermanence.nix)

Changes:
- add the `impermanence` input
- import `impermanence.nixosModules.impermanence` for `predator`
- add a predator-scoped persistence module
- define the centralized inventory with `environment.persistence."/persist"`

Initial inventory must include:
- `/etc/machine-id`
- `/etc/ssh`
- `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`
- `/var/lib/bluetooth`
- `/var/lib/tailscale`
- `/var/lib/docker`
- `/var/lib/systemd/random-seed`

Validation:
- `./scripts/run-validation-gates.sh structure`
- `nix build --no-link path:$PWD#nixosConfigurations.predator.config.system.build.toplevel`
- `nix eval --json path:$PWD#nixosConfigurations.predator.config.environment.persistence`
- `nix store diff-closures` against previous predator system

Expected diff:
- persistence wiring only

Commit target:
- `refactor: add predator impermanence inventory`

### Phase 3: Add the persistence-candidate discovery script

Goal:
- provide a repeatable way to detect new non-persisted root-state paths after future changes

Targets:
- `scripts/report-persistence-candidates.sh`
- docs for its intended use

Behavior:
- inspect the current root filesystem
- ignore mounts already known to be persistent or intentionally separate, such as:
  - `/nix`
  - `/var/log`
  - `/persist`
  - `/home`
  - `/boot`
- surface likely stateful paths under `/etc`, `/var/lib`, and other root-owned locations
- be diagnostic only, not a failing gate

Validation:
- `bash scripts/report-persistence-candidates.sh`
- `bash scripts/check-changed-files-quality.sh`

Commit target:
- `feat: add persistence candidate diagnostic script`

### Phase 4: Live verify the persistence inventory without root reset

Goal:
- prove that the persistence map is correct before touching `@root`

Checks:
- `findmnt /persist`
- verify existence/permissions of persisted targets under `/persist`
- verify Docker still works
- verify Bluetooth, Tailscale, and NetworkManager state remain healthy after `nh os test`

Expected result:
- no change to root lifecycle yet
- only persistence inventory active

Commit target:
- progress log only

### Phase 5: Prepare Btrfs root reset design

Targets:
- [root-reset.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/hardware/predator/root-reset.nix)
- possibly [disko.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/hardware/predator/disko.nix) if mount semantics need adjustment

Changes:
- define the Btrfs root reset mechanism
- keep `@root` recoverable during rollout
- create or maintain a clean root baseline, e.g. `@root-blank`
- wire the reset logic in initrd/early boot

Design rule:
- do not destroy the last known-good `@root` until reboot verification succeeds

Validation:
- `./scripts/run-validation-gates.sh structure`
- `nix build --no-link path:$PWD#nixosConfigurations.predator.config.system.build.toplevel`
- review generated initrd/boot logic
- `nix store diff-closures` against pre-reset system

Commit target:
- `refactor: add predator btrfs root reset wiring`

### Phase 6: Reboot verification

Goal:
- verify the new root lifecycle actually works

Checks after reboot:
- `findmnt /`
- `findmnt /persist`
- `findmnt /var/log`
- Docker health
- `systemctl --failed --no-pager`
- `systemctl --user --failed --no-pager`
- DMS/Niri/session sanity on `predator`

Expected result:
- root reset works
- persisted state survives
- ephemeral state is discarded

Commit target:
- progress log only

### Phase 7: Hibernate/resume compatibility

Goal:
- revalidate suspend-to-disk after the root-reset model is stable

Validation:
- explicit hibernate/resume test
- confirm swap/resume path still works

Commit target:
- `docs: record predator impermanence hibernate compatibility`

## Fallback

If any activation or reboot fails:

1. boot the last known-good generation
2. if needed, mount Btrfs top-level and inspect:
   - `@root`
   - `@root-blank`
   - `@persist`
   - `@log`
3. revert the last impermanence slice
4. do not continue to the next phase until the failing phase is understood

## Success Criteria

This project is done when all of these are true:

- shared features no longer know about `/persist`
- `predator` owns persistence policy in one central module
- `environment.persistence."/persist"` is the single inventory of persisted host state
- Btrfs root reset works on reboot
- Docker state survives reboot
- Bluetooth, Tailscale, NetworkManager, and SSH identity survive reboot
- no regression on `aurelius`
