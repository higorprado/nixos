# Den Philosophy Alignment Refactors Progress

## Status

Completed

## Related Plan

- [028-den-philosophy-alignment-refactors-plan.md](/home/higorprado/nixos/docs/for-agents/archive/plans/028-den-philosophy-alignment-refactors-plan.md)

## Baseline

- The repo had one remaining architectural-risk case in [modules/features/dev/llm-agents.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/dev/llm-agents.nix), where host-wide `nixos.environment.systemPackages` was still coupled to `{ host, user }`.
- Several desktop HM-only feature modules still used `{ host, user }` even though `user` was unused.
- The DMS refactor from the previous slice was already validated and in place.

## Slices

### Slice 1

- Refactored [modules/features/dev/llm-agents.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/dev/llm-agents.nix) from `den.lib.parametric.exactly` with `{ host, user }` to a normal parametric host-aware include using `{ host, ... }`.
- This preserved host-owned HM package fan-out while removing the accidental dependency on HM user context for host-wide NixOS packages.
- Validation run:
  - `nix eval path:$PWD#nixosConfigurations.aurelius.config.system.build.toplevel.drvPath`
- Diff result:
  - host-wide NixOS and HM package propagation now share host context instead of host+user exact context
- Commit:
  - none

### Slice 2

- Narrowed HM-only desktop feature contexts:
  - [modules/features/desktop/desktop-apps.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/desktop/desktop-apps.nix)
  - [modules/features/desktop/dms-wallpaper.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/desktop/dms-wallpaper.nix)
  - [modules/features/desktop/theme-zen.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/desktop/theme-zen.nix)
  - [modules/features/desktop/music-client.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/desktop/music-client.nix)
- Promoted the generic HM block in [modules/features/desktop/theme-base.nix](/home/higorprado/nixos/modules/features/desktop/theme-base.nix) to owned `homeManager` config while retaining host-only `home-manager.sharedModules` registration.
- Validation run:
  - `nix build --no-link path:$PWD#nixosConfigurations.predator.config.home-manager.users.higorprado.home.path`
  - `nix build --no-link path:$PWD#nixosConfigurations.predator.config.system.build.toplevel`
  - `./scripts/check-config-contracts.sh`
- Diff result:
  - context width narrowed without changing intended feature behavior
- Commit:
  - none

### Slice 3

- Ran the repo validation runner after the alignment refactors.
- Validation run:
  - `./scripts/run-validation-gates.sh`
- Diff result:
  - full validation runner finished with `[validation-gates] ok`
- Commit:
  - none

### Slice 4

- Checked the remaining plan-only `aurelius` system build path.
- Validation run:
  - `nix build --no-link path:$PWD#nixosConfigurations.aurelius.config.system.build.toplevel`
- Diff result:
  - build did not complete on this machine because the local builder is `x86_64-linux` and `aurelius` is `aarch64-linux`
  - this was a platform/build-capability mismatch, not an evaluation failure
- Commit:
  - none

## Final State

- The remaining den-philosophy follow-up changes were implemented.
- The repo now uses narrower context shapes in the audited files.
- `predator` eval/build and the repo gate runner passed after the refactor.
- `aurelius` still evaluates successfully; full local build remains constrained by host architecture.
