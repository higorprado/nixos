# Multiple Hosts

## How hosts are declared

Each tracked host has:
- `hardware/<name>/default.nix`
- `modules/hosts/<name>.nix`

`modules/hosts/<name>.nix` declares one concrete dendritic configuration that
composes published feature modules and imports hardware config.

## Adding a new host

Use the skeleton script:

```bash
scripts/new-host-skeleton.sh <host-name> [desktop|server] [desktop-experience]
```

Then adjust the generated `modules/hosts/<name>.nix` imports and hardware files
as needed.

See [workflow: add a host](workflows/103-add-host.md).

## Current tracked hosts

- `predator` and `aurelius` are the only tracked live hosts.
- new host onboarding is handled by the generator and its fixture tests, not by
  keeping tracked example hosts in the live configuration surface.
